# Wheat-Disease-Prediction
In my latest project on wheat disease prediction, I utilized two models: a custom Convolutional Neural Network  and the pre-trained Xception model. The dataset included 4 classes, each with 1111 images. After completing preprocessing and data augmentation, the CNN outperformed Xception in training. The final model chosen for predictions is the CNN.
