Wheat Disease Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting wheat diseases using deep learning models. The dataset consists of 4 classes of wheat diseases, with each class containing 1111 images.
Key Features

    Data Preprocessing: Includes data augmentation and simple processing steps to enhance model performance.
    Models Used:
        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Trained from scratch.
        Pretrained Xception Model: Utilized for transfer learning.

After extensive training and evaluation, the CNN model outperformed the Xception model and was selected for the final predictions.
Repository Contents

    Data Preprocessing Scripts: Code for data augmentation and preprocessing.
    Model Training Scripts: Implementation of both CNN and Xception models.
    Evaluation Metrics: Comparison of model performance.
    Final Prediction Script: Code for making predictions using the trained CNN model.
